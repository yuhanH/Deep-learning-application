# Deep-learning-application

This is the repo that summarizes my previous application of deep learning in biology data.
1	Sequential functional states analysis of scCUT&TAG-Pro data using convolution neural network (2021)  
2 Graph Laplacians and graph convolutional network for single-cell genomics data (2021)  
3 Image registration and transfer learning analysis to diagnose COVID19 pneumonia from X-ray images (2020)
